The Astronomy Plug-In by Frederic V. Hessman
============================================

This project is derived from Astronomy.zip downloaded from
[Frederic V. Hessman's website](http://www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~hessman/ImageJ/Astronomy/)
on 2018-12-08.

The version is identified as 2017-12-04.

The aim of the present project is to (a) get the sources from Hessman's
project into GitHub, and (b) reorganize those sources so that the plug-in
can be built by Maven.

Documentation

Hessman's plugin documentation and the original zip file are preserved in the 
[doc](./doc) directory.
